variables
----------------

    1. local variables 

    2. instance variables 

    3. static variables 


non-access modifiers 
-------------------------

    1. static keyword
        - static variables 
            - declared inside a class
            - has only 1 copy 
        - static methods 
            - static methods are accessed without creating object of the class 
        - static class 

    2. final keyword 
        - final variable 

        - final method 

        - final class 


class InputStream {

}

class System {

    static InputStream in;
    static OutputStream out;
}

System.in - "in" is a ref variable of type InputStream, which by default points to the input stream of standard keyboard 
System.out = "out" 

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)

git add . 



git add hello.txt, goodday.txt, goodbye.txt

Arrays in java
-------------------

**Array Declaration

    <<datatype>>[] var;  

    int[] arr; 

    short[] arr;  

    byte[] arr; 

    char[] arr; 

    String[] arr;  

    Employee[] arr;  

    Student[] arr;  


**Create array / create array object 

        arrVarName = new <datatype>[size];

        arr = new int[5];


        int[][] data = new int[2][5];



    - java.util package provides "Arrays" class which provides various methods to manage/manipulate arrays 


    String in java
    -----------------------

        Create 

            1. using string literals 

                    String str = "Welcome"; 

            2. using constructor (new keyword )

                    String str = new String("Welcome");

- Java basics 
    - variables
    - data types
    - flow control 
    - arrays 
    - strings 
    - regex 

- OOPS Concepts 
-------------------
    - OOP is a way to model software as "real-world entities" (objects) that: 
        - have "State" (data) 
        - have "behavior" (functions / methods)
        - interact with each other 


    - Banking Software 
        - Customer has data (name, accoutid, balance, KYC details, etc.)
        - Customer can do actions (open accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer etc.)
        - different customer behave similary but have different values (balance differs)

    - OOP lets you represent this in code cleanly. 


    Classes and Objects 
    ----------------------
        - Class 
            - a class is a blueprint / template describes 
                - what data an entity has (fields / variables / properties )
                - what is can do (methods)
        - Object 
            - an object is a real instance created from the class at runtime 

        
        class BankAccount {

                //fields / members / instance variables 
                private int accountId;
                private double balance;

                //methods  / instance methods 

                //static variables 

                //static method 

                //constructor/s 

                //inner class 
        }

        BankAccount bankAccount = new BankAccount();


OOPS Concepts 
--------------------
    1. Encapuslation 
        - bundling data + behavior together and controlling access to internal data 
        - a properly encapulated class always has 
            - all members private 
            - has necessary getters / setter methods 



    Constructor in java 
    -------------------------

        - a constructor is a special method-like block executed automatically when you create an object using "new" keyword 
        - name of the constructor method must match the class name 
        - no return type 
        - used to initize the object in a valid state 
        - construtors also ensure your object  starts life in a valid state 


        - Default Constructor (compiler provided)
            - if your class does not have any contructor, then compiler provides a "default constructor" which intializes the default values to the data memebres 

        - no-arg constructor 
            - you can define a constructor without any parameters 

        - pameterized constructor 
            - enforce that the required fields are set at creation time

        - constructor overloading 
            - multiple constructors with different parameters 

        - valid access modifiers for constructors 
            - public 
                - constrcutor can be accessed from anywhere, objects can be created from any package 
            - protected 
                - accessible only within the same package 
                - in subclasses, even in different packages 
            - private 
                - accessible within the same class 
            - default (no modifer is used)
                - accessible only withing the same package 

    - Method Overloading (compile time polymorphism)
    ----------------------------
        - same method name, different pameter list 
            - different number of pameters or 
            - different types or 
            - different order or types 

        - Java picks the “most specific” match, by matching the pameters between the calling method and declared methods 
        - this decision is taken during compile time 

        When does the static binding happens?
            - when the method call is resolved at compile time it is called "Static binding"
            - static methods 
            - final methods - always bound at compile time 
            - private methods - compiler binds private methods at compile time
            - method overloading - depends on parameters / parameter types, it is decided at compile time 


            class Parent {
                static void show(){
                    sysout("Parent");
                }
            }

            class Child extends Parent {
                static void show(){
                    sysout("Child");
                }
            }

            Parent p = new Child();
            p.show();       //it will call parent class show() 
                            //because method is static it is not overridden, 
                            and the method call is resolved by reference type

    ***NOTE: in java, a parent class variable can reference to a child object 
    ***NOTE: in java, an interface variable can reference to an object of it's implementation class


Inheritance 
---------------------
    - mechanism where a class (subclass/childclass) acquires the properties and behavior of 
        another class (parentclass/superclass)
    
    why inheritance:
    - reusability (code reuse)
    - local hierarchy modeling
    - enalble runtime polymorphism
    - reduces duplication

    - inheritance represents IS-A relationship between super class and sub class 
    - in java, we use 'extends' keyword to inherit class 

        public class Child extends Parent {

        }

    - java supports "Single Inheritance" for classes 
    - Child class can :
        - inherit all non-private members (variables and methods)
        - override super class methods
        - additional members
    - constructors are not inherited, but the parent class constructor can be invoked 
        through "super()"   
    - by default, child class constructor always invoks superclass's no-arg constructor (if the super() is not used)

BankAccount
 - customerId
 - name
 - address
 - openAccount()               
      |
      |
---------------------------------------------------------------
SavingAccount           CurrentAccount              LoanAccount
   |
   |
   |
PremiumSavingAccount
SalarySavingAccount
EliteSavingAccount

SavingAccount IS-A BankAccount 
PremiumSavingAccount IS-A SavingAccount
PremiumSavingAccount IS-A BankAccount 


Object class 
-------------
    - Object class is the "root" class for all the classes in java 
    - object class is the super most / top most class in java 
    - this Object class provides some common methods that every java object must have   
        - public boolean equals(Object obj) - allow to implement a way to prove equality 
        - public int hashCode() - to represent an identity
        - public String toString()  - allows to implement a way to describe the object 
        - public void finalize()
        - public void wait()
        - public void notify()
        - public void notifyAll()


    public class A {
        public boolean equals(Object obj){}
        public int hashCode(){}
        public String toString() {}
    }

    public class Student {

            public boolean equals(Object obj){}
            public int hashCode(){}
            public String toString() {}
    }

    public class Teacher {
            public boolean equals(Object obj){}
            public int hashCode(){}
            public String toString() {}
    }

    public class Engineer {
            public boolean equals(Object obj){}
            public int hashCode(){}
            public String toString() {}
    }

    public class Doctor {
            public boolean equals(Object obj){}
            public int hashCode(){}
            public String toString() {}
    }



    Object obj = new Student();

    Object obj = new Doctor()
    


    Real-life example using Inheritance 
    ---------------------------------------
        - e-commerce order fullfillment system
        - a company that ships different kind of "orders"


        Common to all ordres 
        ----------------------
            - orderId
            - customerInfo
            - items and base price
            - taxCalculation
            - discount handling 
            - final payable amount
            - status (PLACED -> PAID -> PACKED -> SHIPPING -> DELIVERED)

        Types of Orders:
            1. DigitalOrders 
                    - no shipping 
                    - instance delivery via download link / email 
                    - tax rules may differ 
            2. PhysicalOrders 
                    - requires packaging, shipping, courier tracking 
            3. FragileOrders
                    - extra packaging charges 
                    - courier requires "fragile handling" service 
            4. InternationalOrders
                    - custom duties + extra compliance 
                    - tax rules different 
            5. SubscriptionOrders 
                    - recurring billing cycles
                    - prorated discount, recurring shippments 

            Order (orderId, customerEmail, address, items[], baseAmount, discount, status)
                |-DigitalOrder
                |-PhysicalOrder (shippingAddress, courierPartner)
                    |-FragileOrder
                    |-InternationalOrder
                    |-SubscriptionOrder



    Enum in Java
    -====================
        - enum (Enumeration) is a special data type used to defined "fixed set of named constants"
        - enum constants are objects 
        - enum implicitely extends from java.lang.Enum 
        - enum can have fields, constructors, methods 
        - enum instances are sigleton 

        enum Day {
            MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY
        } 


        class Day extends Enum<Day>{
            public static final Day MONDAY = new Day();
            public static final Day TUESDAY = new Day();
            public static final Day WEDNESDAY = new Day();

        }


Why java doesn't support multiple inheritance 
-----------------------------------------
    - avoid ambiguity in method resolution, data conflicts, constructor intitialization issues 
    - avoid commonly known diamond problem 
    --**Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces - ensures clarity, type safety and predicatable runtime behavior 




Abstract classes 
------------------------
    - an abstract class in java is a class that cannot be instantiated and it is designed to be 
        extended by subclasses / designed to act only as a superclass containing common variables / methods

    - an abstract class contains    
        - abstract methods 
        - concrete methods 
        - fields / data members / variables / instance variables 
        - constructors 




    abstract class Car {

        public abstract void move();
    }

    class TataCar extends Car {

        @Override 
        public void move(){
            sysout("This car moves smooth");
        }
    }

    class BMWCar extends Car {

        @Override 
        public void move(){
            sysout("This car moves fast");
        }
    }

    class MercedesCar extends Car {
       
        @Override 
        public void move(){
            sysout("This car moves fast as well smooth");
        }
    }

    Car car1 = new TataCar();
    car1.move();


    Car car2 = new BMWCar();
    car2.move();



    Abstract methods
    -----------------------
        - abstract methods are declared without body 
        - abstract methods must be overridden in the immediate subclass 
      


    Intefaces in java 
    ---------------------------
        - an interface in java is a "pure contract" that defines what a class "Can do"
        - an interface defines set of requirements that a class has to implement

        - a class can use "implments" keyword to implement an interface 
        - a class that implements an interface must override all the abstract methods 

        - a class can implement several interfaces 
        - an interface can extend several interfaces 

        - (java 7) interface contains only "abstract" methods  
        - (java 8) - enhanced interface concepts in java 8

            - interface can contain concrete "public" and "static" methods as well 

        - (java 9) - interface can contain "private" methods 

            
            **Functional Interface (Java 8)
                - an interface that contains exactly 1 abstract method is called "Functional Interface" 

                    interface A {
                        public abstract void someMethod();
                    }

            ** Functional Interface provided by Java 

                    supplier 
                    consumer 
                    function




    public interface Taxable {

        public abstract double calculateTax();
    }

    public interface GiftPackaged {

        public abstract void giftPackage();
    }


    public ElectronicProducts extends Product implements Taxable, GiftPackaged {

        @override 
        public double calculateTax(){

        }
    }



    interface Singer {

        void sing();
    }

    interface Dancer {

        void dance()
    }

    interface TalentedStudent extends Singer, Dancer {

    }


    class Student implements Singer, Dancer {


            //override all the abstract methods 

    }





    Abstract classs                                          interface 

    may / may not have abstract methods                 has only abstract method 

    "What" is the object?                               "What Can" the object do?

    share common state + behavior                       pure abstract / pure contracts
                                                        defines set of requirements that a class must implement 

    can have                                            can have 
        - static members                                    - constants (static final variables )
        - instance members                                  - abstract methods 
        - constructors                                      - public members 
        - concrete methods                                  - (java 8) - concrete "public" and "static" methods
        - may have abstract mehtods 
        - private, protected, public members                - (java 9) - allows concrete "private" methods 
        - final methods 


    abstract classes represent real objects             interface represents "capabilities" / "requirements", not objects 

    a class can extends from only 1 class               a class can implement multiple interfaces 




    **Why interfaces are called "pure contracts" 

        - a contract is "formal promise" between two parties 
            - provider : promises certain behavior 
            - consumer : relies on that promise without knowing implementation details 

        - in software terms: a contract defines "What must be done" 

        - an interface defines a contract, that a class must implement some requirements 

        public interface Taxable {

            void calculateTax();
        }
