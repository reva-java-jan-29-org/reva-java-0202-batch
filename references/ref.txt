TERMS:
---------------

    - POJO - Plain old java object
        - any ordinary java class can be pojo
        - it has private members (data members / variables) and public getter/setter methods 


    - BO - Business Object 
        - represents a business entity 

    - SO - Service Object 
        - used to write the business logic 
        - classes that represents business logic 

    - DAO - Data Access Object 
        - logic to connect with the database and perform db related operations 

    - DTO - Data Transfer Object 

    - VO - Value object

variables
----------------

    1. local variables 

    2. instance variables 

    3. static variables 


non-access modifiers 
-------------------------

    1. static keyword
        - static variables 
            - declared inside a class
            - has only 1 copy 
        - static methods 
            - static methods are accessed without creating object of the class 
        - static class 

    2. final keyword 
        - final variable 

        - final method 

        - final class 


class InputStream {

}

class System {

    static InputStream in;
    static OutputStream out;
}

System.in - "in" is a ref variable of type InputStream, which by default points to the input stream of standard keyboard 
System.out = "out" 

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)

git add . 



git add hello.txt, goodday.txt, goodbye.txt 

git add 


Arrays in java
-------------------

**Array Declaration

    <<datatype>>[] var;  

    int[] arr; 

    short[] arr;  

    byte[] arr; 

    char[] arr; 

    String[] arr;  

    Employee[] arr;  

    Student[] arr;  


**Create array / create array object 

        arrVarName = new <datatype>[size];

        arr = new int[5];


        int[][] data = new int[2][5];



    - java.util package provides "Arrays" class which provides various methods to manage/manipulate arrays 


    String in java
    -----------------------

        Create 

            1. using string literals 

                    String str = "Welcome"; 

            2. using constructor (new keyword )

                    String str = new String("Welcome");

    - variables
    - data types
    - flow control 
    - arrays 
    - strings 
    - regex 

- OOPS Concepts 
-------------------
    - OOP is a way to model software as "real-world entities" (objects) that: 
        - have "State" (data) 
        - have "behavior" (functions / methods)
        - interact with each other 


    - Banking Software 
        - Customer has data (name, accoutid, balance, KYC details, etc.)
        - Customer can do actions (open accounts, deposit, withdraw, transfer etc.)
        - different customer behave similary but have different values (balance differs)

    - OOP lets you represent this in code cleanly. 


    Classes and Objects 
    ----------------------
        - Class 
            - a class is a blueprint / template describes 
                - what data an entity has (fields / variables / properties )
                - what is can do (methods)
        - Object 
            - an object is a real instance created from the class at runtime 

        
        class BankAccount {

                //fields / members / instance variables 
                private int accountId;
                private double balance;

                //methods  / instance methods 

                //static variables 

                //static method 

                //constructor/s 

                //inner class 
        }

        BankAccount bankAccount = new BankAccount();


OOPS Concepts 
--------------------
    1. Encapuslation 
        - bundling data + behavior together and controlling access to internal data 
        - a properly encapulated class always has 
            - all members private 
            - has necessary getters / setter methods 



    Constructor in java 
    -------------------------

        - a constructor is a special method-like block executed automatically when you create an object using "new" keyword 
        - name of the constructor method must match the class name 
        - no return type 
        - used to initize the object in a valid state 
        - construtors also ensure your object  starts life in a valid state 


        - Default Constructor (compiler provided)
            - if your class does not have any contructor, then compiler provides a "default constructor" which intializes the default values to the data memebres 

        - no-arg constructor 
            - you can define a constructor without any parameters 

        - pameterized constructor 
            - enforce that the required fields are set at creation time

        - constructor overloading 
            - multiple constructors with different parameters 

        - valid access modifiers for constructors 
            - public 
                - constrcutor can be accessed from anywhere, objects can be created from any package 
            - protected 
                - accessible only within the same package 
                - in subclasses, even in different packages 
            - private 
                - accessible within the same class 
            - default (no modifer is used)
                - accessible only withing the same package 



    - Method Overloading (compile time polymorphism)
    ----------------------------
        - same method name, different pameter list 
            - different number of pameters or 
            - different types or 
            - different order or types 

        - Java picks the “most specific” match, by matching the pameters between the calling method and declared methods 
        - this decision is taken during compile time 


        When does the static binding happens?
            - when the method call is resolved at compile time it is called "Static binding"
            - static methods 
            - final methods - always bound at compile time 
            - private methods - compiler binds private methods at compile time
            - method overloading - depends on parameters / parameter types, it is decided at compile time 


            class Parent {
                static void show(){
                    sysout("Parent");
                }
            }

            class Child extends Parent {
                static void show(){
                    sysout("Child");
                }
            }

            Parent p = new Child();
            p.show();       //it will call parent class show() 
                            //because method is static it is not overridden, 
                            and the method call is resolved by reference type

    ***NOTE: in java, a parent class variable can reference to a child object 
    ***NOTE: in java, an interface variable can reference to an object of it's implementation class
